<!--# Purpose and Goals of the Group-->

The ODIN S3 Study Group was established to provide a collaborative space for individuals and teams interested in implementing S3 within their organizations. Our primary goals include:

- **Learning Together**: We believe in the power of shared learning. Our study group is designed to facilitate collective exploration and understanding of S3 principles, patterns, and practices.
    
- **Practical Application**: Beyond theoretical knowledge, our focus is on practical application. We encourage participants to bring their real-world challenges and successes to the group, fostering a rich learning environment.
    
- **Community Building**: We aim to build a strong, connected community that supports each other in our S3 journeys. By sharing experiences and insights, we strengthen our collective ability to create positive change.
    

We invite you to join us in this journey of learning and growth, as we work together to build more resilient and adaptive organizations using the S3 framework.

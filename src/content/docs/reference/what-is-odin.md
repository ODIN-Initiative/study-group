<!-- # **What is ODIN?** -->

## Understanding the ODIN Community

ODIN (Open Decentralized Innovation Network) is a collaborative community dedicated to exploring and advancing decentralized innovation as a means to solve complex global challenges. We believe that decentralized innovation networks will be the primary way to address hard problems in the world, fostering a more equitable and sustainable future.

At the core of ODIN's mission is the belief that by experimenting with and mentoring evolutionary organizational principles, we can create scalable, high-trust networks where innovation and collaboration can flourish. These principles guide everything we do, from our daily interactions to the larger projects we undertake.

## ODIN's Connection to Sociocracy 3.0

Sociocracy 3.0 (S3) aligns closely with ODIN's values and goals, making it a natural framework for our community. By adopting and practicing S3 principles, we aim to model the kind of governance and collaboration we wish to see in the world. The ODIN S3 Study Group is a reflection of our commitment to learning and applying these principles in real time, providing a space where members can both study and practice S3 within the context of our community.

## ODIN's Broader Activities and Connections

Beyond the S3 Study Group, ODIN hosts several weekly meetings that focus on various aspects of decentralized innovation, governance, and collaboration. We are deeply connected to the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, including initiatives like Project Catalyst and Intersect MBO. These connections allow us to both contribute to and learn from some of the most forward-thinking communities in the decentralized space.

ODIN is also guided by foundational works such as _Working with Source_, _Reinventing Organizations_, _Brave New Work_, and _Emergent Strategy_. These texts inform our approach to organizational development and innovation, helping us to remain agile and responsive in a rapidly changing world.

In everything we do, we strive to practice what we preach. The principles of Sociocracy 3.0 are not just something we studyâ€”they are embedded in the way we operate, helping us to create a more inclusive, effective, and resilient community.

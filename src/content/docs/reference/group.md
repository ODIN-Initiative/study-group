## How the Study Group Sessions are Organized

The ODIN S3 Study Group meets every Monday to dive deep into the principles and patterns of Sociocracy 3.0 (S3). While we occasionally take breaks, our regular meetings are designed to be a consistent space for learning, discussion, and collaboration.

Here is the [ODIN community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=odinsharedcalendar@gmail.com&ctz=America/New_York)

Each session begins with a brief check-in, allowing participants to connect and share any relevant updates. After the check-in, we move directly into the main focus of the meeting: a presentation by one of our researchers.

## What Participants Can Expect to Learn and Do

Our researchers are volunteers from within the ODIN community who have chosen to study a specific pattern from the S3 pattern map. These presentations are not about expert lectures; instead, they are an opportunity for community-driven learning. The researcher's role is to present the context of the chosen pattern and explore how it fits within the broader S3 framework.

We encourage a structured approach to these presentations, with the goal of fostering rich discussions while keeping the session concise. As a general guideline, we suggest that presentations, including the discussion, should last no more than 30 minutes. This time can be divided flexibly, but it's important to leave space for both presenting and for Q&A. A typical structure might include 5 to 10 minutes of presentation followed by 5 to 10 minutes of Q&A.

While the check-ins are private and not recorded, the presentations are streamed live to our YouTube channel, where they are also archived for future viewing. We share these videos on our social media platforms to reach a wider audience.

Coordination for these sessions, including sign-ups for presentations, is managed through our Discord server and weekly Miro boards. A sign-up chart is available on Miro, making it easy for members to volunteer as researchers or facilitators.

We are currently seeking grants to provide compensation for those who facilitate the meetings and for the individual researchers who dedicate their time to studying and presenting S3 patterns. Presentations are open to anyone within the ODIN network, and we encourage all members to take part in this collaborative learning journey.

# Exploring the Patterns of Sociocracy 3.0

The Sociocracy 3.0 (S3) framework is rich with patternsâ€”principles and methods that organizations can use to improve their sense-making, decision-making, and overall effectiveness. These patterns provide a common language and focal points for addressing organizational challenges in a structured and specific way.

Our study group delves into these patterns, exploring their practical applications and how they can be used to foster more collaborative, transparent, and adaptive organizations. The map of S3 patterns, featured below, categorizes these methods into key areas such as Sense-Making & Decision-Making, Evolving Organizations, and Defining Agreements, among others.

In the following section, you'll find detailed presentations on select S3 patterns. Each card below links to a recorded session where a specific pattern is explored in depth. These presentations are designed to help you understand how each pattern fits into the broader S3 framework and how it can be applied in real-world contexts.

# Fund13
Please give kudos or leave a comment on our Fund13 proposal - 

[CIP-1694 Governance Skills Development](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/129824)

:::note[Heads up]
The proposal is called one thing, but we commonly call the project **"ODIN Study Group"**.  Our focus has always been S3, community governance, and collaboration.  With this proposal, we plan to focus more on CIP-1694 concepts and principles.

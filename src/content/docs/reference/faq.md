<details>
  <summary>How many presentations can I do?</summary>
  <p>A single person can only research and present 5 presentation.  Max 5 presentations per person. We are trying to do 32 presentations in 16 meetings over 4 months. The lowest number of presenters would be 6. The highest number of presenters would be - theorically - 32.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why 32 patterns?</summary>
  <p>Why not? And, there are 79 S3 patterns but we aren't limited to those patterns. We think we can make an impact over 4 months of weekly, 60 minute meetings, where we do 2 presentations per meeting.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do you think you can pull this off?</summary>
  <p>Well, we are doing it weekly now, but we think with funding we can grow our community and impact.  Check out more about ODIN at https://odin.eco</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What patterns can I present?</summary>
  <p>We use the S3 patterns as a base but any published and valid pattern will work. In Fund13 we are focused on the concepts and principles of CIP-1694</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What if my presentation sucks, will I still get paid?</summary>
  <p>Maybe. Let us decide if it sucks. The real goal isn't a fancy presentation but a true learning experience for you (the presenter) and us (the community).</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I be the catalyst coordinator AND a meeting facilitator?</summary>
  <p>Yep, everyone can hold multiple roles and hold them one or more times.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I'd like to be a meeting facilitator. How can I apply?</summary>
  <p>Just come to an ODIN S3 Meeting and let us know your intention.  You can join our discord and get to know us better.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I get paid?</summary>
  <p>For the time being, just send an address and the administrator will make payment transactions at each milestone.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is ODIN?</summary>
  <p>ODIN is a group that helps people work together better by using new and fair ways to make decisions and get things done. They want to replace old, top-down methods with more inclusive and efficient ones, so everyone can have a say and contribute easily. ODIN's goal is to empower people and organizations to solve problems together and set a new example for teamwork and decision-making in the digital world. <a href="https://www.odin.eco/">See more at https://www.odin.eco/</a></p>

<details>
  <summary>How do I join the team? Can I be the Catalyst Administrator?</summary>
  <p>Simply attend one of the two ODIN meetings held each week and ask to be a part. Nori is doing the Catalyst reporting to begin the project, but if you have the skill and desire, I'm sure he would consider the request and appreciate the help.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is this good for Cardano? Why should Catalyst funds be used in this project?</summary>
  <p>With Voltaire coming online, we will need better habits of decision making and collaboration. This project will help by giving our community the experience and exposure to new habits and creating the opportunity to practice them.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is this a 'bounty' program for collaboration and governance presentations?</summary>
  <p>Yeah, basically.</p>

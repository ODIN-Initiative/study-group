# Guidelines for Participants Who Want to Present or Lead a Session

Presenting at the ODIN S3 Study Group is a straightforward and rewarding experience. We encourage all members of the ODIN community to take part in our collaborative learning journey by leading a session on one of the many patterns within the Sociocracy 3.0 (S3) framework.

To sign up as a presenter, simply attend one of our ODIN meetings on Thursdays. During these meetings, you can choose an available pattern from our S3 pattern map. We use a chart and a Miro board to keep track of who is presenting which pattern, making it easy for everyone to see what’s available and plan their contributions.

## Contribution Rewards and Sign-Up Process

Currently, presentations are done on a volunteer basis, and we deeply appreciate the time and effort that our community members put into preparing and leading these sessions. While we are actively seeking sponsorship to provide financial rewards for these contributions, the true value lies in the opportunity to learn, share, and grow together as a community.

If you’re interested in presenting, we encourage you to reach out during our Thursday meetings or contact one of the study group organizers for more information. We look forward to your contributions and to the continued growth of our shared knowledge and experience.

## Proposed Guidelines for Our Presentations

To ensure our presentations are consistent and impactful, we’ve established a few key guidelines.

30-60 Second Video Abstract: Start with a brief video abstract summarizing the core message of your presentation. This can also be adapted into textual summaries for sharing across different media.

Orientation (1-2 Minutes): Begin by orienting the audience on where the pattern fits within the broader S3 framework. Explain how it connects with other collaboration patterns, where it can be found in the S3 site, and how it relates to our Collaborative Sparks website.

Core Content in 5-10 Minutes: Aim to convey 80% of the presentation’s overall meaning within the first 7 minutes give or take. This approach leaves ample time for discussion. If you have additional details or fine points, consider saving them for the discussion phase, where they can add significant value.

Facilitation and Iteration: It’s perfectly acceptable to focus on facilitating a conversation rather than delivering a traditional presentation. Gather insights from the discussion to refine and potentially develop a version 2 of your presentation.
